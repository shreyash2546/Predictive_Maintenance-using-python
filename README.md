# Predictive_Maintenance using python

Real-Time Machine Monitoring ðŸš¨

Monitor 10 machines in real-time with temperature and vibration sensors! The system flags machines that need maintenance, prints live alerts, and shows animated charts highlighting issues instantly.

This project simulates and monitors the real-time condition of 10 machines using temperature and vibration sensor data. Sensor readings are generated dynamically, and the system continuously checks for values exceeding predefined thresholds (temperature > 90Â°C, vibration > 0.05). Machines exceeding these limits are flagged as requiring maintenance, while others are marked as healthy.

Features:

Real-time simulation of sensor data

Automatic maintenance alerts for high temperature or vibration

Live, interactive visualizations with Matplotlib

Helps predict maintenance and reduce downtime

Tech Stack: Python | Pandas | NumPy | Matplotlib


Technologies Used

Python â€“ main programming language

Pandas â€“ data management and analysis

NumPy â€“ generating random sensor data

Matplotlib & FuncAnimation â€“ real-time visualization
